        The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the output.
        Each fraction (input and output) has the format Â±numerator/denominator. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
        The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1, 10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
        The number of given fractions will be in the range [1, 10].
        The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.
